Description: Remove dependencies on catkin_pkg to avoid conflict with ROS 1
 While the package is available from Debian this Debian package only
 depends on python3-catkin-pkg-modules to avoid the collision with the
 Python 2 version of the package.
 Otherwise being listed as a install_requires but not being installed
 would result in a runtime error by pkg_resources.
